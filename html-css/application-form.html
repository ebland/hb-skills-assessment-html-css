(DONE)A form that asks the user:
(DONE)their first and last name (as separate fields),
(TODO done)their salary requirement as a number, and. (Put Salary in )
(DONE) which job they are applying for, as a dropdown from a list of:
(DONE) Software Engineer
(DONE) QA Engineer
(DONE) Product Manager
(TODO) The form should use HTML 5 input types for validation. 
(DONE) The form should also have a submit button that submits the form to the URL (DONE) path /application-success. This should be a POST request. (For now, just focus on the HTML requirements for this request. Donâ€™t build a Flask route, yet.)
The page should have a large heading and some explanatory text, as well.
